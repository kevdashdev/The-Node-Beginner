## About
Repo for the scripts written while working along The Node Beginner Book by Manuel Kiessling. Definitely learned more about node.js than the previous hour or so. :thumbsup:

Appreciate the occassional food for thought blog posts scattered throughout too, especially this one by [Felix Geisend√∂rfer](http://debuggable.com/posts/understanding-node-js:4bd98440-45e4-4a9a-8ef7-0f7ecbdd56cb). Not only is the post interesting, the blog design is something that I really dig too! Don't even get me started on that cockroach(easter egg?).

Next up, Hands-on Node.js by Pedro Teixeira.
